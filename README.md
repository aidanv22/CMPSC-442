This course provides an overview of the foundations, problems, approaches, implementation, and applications of artificial intelligence. Topics covered include problem solving, goal-based and adversarial search, logical, probabilistic, and decision theoretic knowledge representation and inference, decision making, and learning. Through programming assignments that sample these topics, students acquire an understanding of what it means to build rational agents of different sorts as well as applications of AI techniques in language processing, planning, vision.

 

The goal of this course is to learn basic techniques for building intelligent computer systems:

Search, (games,) constraint satisfaction, uncertainty and probability, Bayes Rule, Naïve Bayes, Hidden Markov Models
Introduction to fundamental concepts in machine learning: linear regression, linear regression classifier, perceptron learning rule
